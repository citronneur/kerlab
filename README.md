# Kerlab
A Rust version of Kekeo for playing with kerberos

Kerlab was developped just to drill down *kerberos* protocol and better understand it.
The main pupose is to write more targeted detection rules. 
These rules was presented during the (Toulouse Hacking Conference 2021)[https://thcon.party/] that took place on 11 of june.

:warning: Kerlab needs the nightly version of rust because we massively use static parameters for template :warning:
